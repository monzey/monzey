# 👋 Hey, I'm Max

I'm a developer who likes to go deep:  
I automate, I self-host, I prototype fast.

I believe in **local-first tools**, **clean architecture**, and **AI with purpose** — not hype.

## 🚧 Projects I'm exploring

- 🎮 [**Zacian**](https://github.com/monzey/zacian) — multiplayer RPG combat engine  
- 🧙‍♂️ [**Darkrai**](https://github.com/monzey/darkrai) — RPG world generator powered by LLMs, RAG, and CLI magic

## ⚙️ My environment

🧬 Built almost entirely with [**Nix**](https://nixos.org)  
🧑‍💻 Managed via [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager)  
🧳 Designed to be **portable**, **reproducible**, and **fully mine**

## 🎯 Why I build

To craft tools that:
- 🧑‍🚀 Make solo dev efficient
- 🎨 Bring creativity to code
- 🔐 Respect users' agency
